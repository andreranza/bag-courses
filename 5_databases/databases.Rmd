# General remarks

- We hope for these courses to be interactive: go ahead and ask if something is unclear!
- You can also write into the chat, which I will try to monitor when Kirill is presenting.
- We were asked to provide recordings of the courses for those of you who cannot join, so recording is activated.
- Per course unit, we offer 4 hours of follow up time; approach us with questions (nicolas@cynkra.com)!
