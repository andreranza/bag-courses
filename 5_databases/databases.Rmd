# Course material

Our course material currently is available from GitHub at

https://github.com/cynkra/bag-courses

Today we will be looking at the folder `5_databases`

# General remarks

- We hope for these courses to be interactive: go ahead and ask if something is unclear!
- You can also write into the chat, which I will try to monitor when Kirill is presenting.
- We were asked to provide recordings of the courses for those of you who cannot join, so recording is activated.
- Per course unit, we offer 4 hours of follow up time; approach us with questions (nicolas@cynkra.com)!

# Goals for today

Playing the whole game!

- Extract
- Transform
- Load
- **Consume**

---

# Schedule

Extract ⇨ Transform ⇨ Load ⇨ Consume

.pull-left[
## One table

- Read whole tables
- Let the database do the heavy lifting
- Subtle issues to watch out for
- Basic ETL for one table
]

.pull-right[
## Multiple tables

- Joins
- The {dm} package
- A bit of theory
- Playing the whole game
]

## Bonus: Bring your own data + questions

# Read whole tables

- {DBI} package
- Connect
- Discover
- Read
- Query

Script: `databases_11.R`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
```

---

# Connect to the database

First step when accessing the database.

```{r}
con_duckdb <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())
con_duckdb
```

insert: duckdb logo, other database logos

---

insert: major boring shit

---

# Prepare database

Normally done in a preparatory step.

insert: bunny

```{r}
dm::copy_dm_to(
  con_duckdb,
  dm::dm_pixarfilms(),
  set_key_constraints = FALSE,
  temporary = FALSE
)
```

---

# Discover tables

Where is my data?

```{r}
dbListTables(con_duckdb)
dbListFields(con_duckdb, "pixar_films")
```

Caveat: schemas, catalogs, ...

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
```

---

# Read tables

Read entire tables into your local session, if you can afford it.

```{r}
df_pixar_films <- dbReadTable(con_duckdb, "pixar_films")
df_pixar_films
```

---

# Read tables

Use `as_tibble()` to convert to a tibble for better display
and more robust operation.

```{r}
df_pixar_films <- dbReadTable(con_duckdb, "pixar_films")
as_tibble(df_pixar_films)
```

---

# Execute queries

Write SQL code to define what data you want to see.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con_duckdb, "SELECT * FROM pixar_films")
```

---

# Execute queries

Write complex SQL code to define what data you want to see.

```{r}
sql <- "
SELECT * FROM pixar_films
WHERE release_date >= '2020-01-01'
"
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con_duckdb, sql)
```

---

# Execute queries

R 4.0 or later: use new-style string literals for mixing quotes.

```{r eval = FALSE}
sql <- r"(
SELECT * FROM "pixar_films"
WHERE "release_date" >= '2020-01-01'
)"
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con_duckdb, sql)
```

---

# Quoting

insert: bunny

```{r}
dbQuoteIdentifier(con_duckdb, "academy")
dbQuoteLiteral(con_duckdb, "Toy Story")
dbQuoteLiteral(con_duckdb, as.Date("2020-01-01"))
```

---

# Parameterized queries

insert: bunny

```{r}
sql <- "SELECT count(*) FROM pixar_films WHERE release_date >= ?"
dbGetQuery(con_duckdb, sql, params = list(as.Date("2020-01-01")))
```
