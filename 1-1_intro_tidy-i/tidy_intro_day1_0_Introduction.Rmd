# Introduction

Organization of half-day R courses:

- Intro courses:
  * Tidyverse intro I (this course)
  * Tidyverse intro II
  * Data visualization I
  * Data visualization II
- Advanced courses:
  * Advanced tidyverse (this afternoon)
  * R package creation
  * Working with database systems
  * Parallelization & efficient R programming
  * Advanced topics (tbd)

???
Antoine and I would like to welcome you on behalf of Cynkra. In the coming weeks we will be organizing two sets or R courses, split up as introductory and advanced. Each course will be half a day and the advanced courses are held twice in succession. Today we're starting with a first tidyverse intro course.

# Dates

- Week 1, Jan 25: Tidyverse intro I + Adv. Tidyverse (Antoine)
- Week 2, Feb 1: Tidyverse intro II + Adv. Tidyverse (Antoine)
- Week 3, Feb 8: R-pkg creation (Tobias)
- Week 4, Feb 15: R-pkg creation (Tobias)
- Week 5, Feb 22: Parallelization (Patrick), Feb 24: Data vis. & ggplot2 I (Antoine)
- Week 6, Mar 1: Data vis. & ggplot2 II (Antoine) + Parallelization (Patrick)
- Week 7, Mar 8: Databases (Kirill)
- Week 8, Mar 15: Databases (Kirill)
- Week 9, Mar 22: TBD (?)
- Week 9, Mar 22: TBD (?)

???
Courses are typically held on Tuesdays, with the exception of the first intro course on data visualization. Intro courses are in the mornings, while advanced courses take place on afternoons. We initially were hoping to be able to carry out these courses with physical presence, but at least for now, this is not possible. Hopefully, this will change over the course of the next weeks to months. For each course, two people representing Cynkra will be available, a topic-specific expert, as well as myself in a coordinating role.

# Course material

Our course material currently is available from a Github repository at

https://github.com/cynkra/bag-courses

![how to download](cynkra-repo-dl.png)

???
If anyone has issues accessing this material, let us know, it's important to us that you have the code available to experiment with.

---

# General remarks

- Even though we are starting out remotely, we hope for these courses to be interactive: go ahead and ask if something is unclear!
- We were asked to provide recordings of the courses for those of you who cannot join, so recording is activated
- Per course unit, we offer 4 hours of follow up time; approach us with questions (nicolas@cynkra.com)!

???
We're not only here to tell you some new and interesting things about R, but we'd also like to help you apply that knowledge to actual scenarios you're dealing with. So in this course follow up time, we're happy to help you with questions you might have regarding course material. But we would like to also offer our help with questions that come up when applying R to your day to day tasks. If you have a question you'd like to discuss, write us an email and we will schedule a meeting.

# Tidyverse intro I-0

* Introducing the tidyverse
* Packages of the tidyverse
* Getting help

---

# Introducing the tidyverse

Collection of data science tools

--

* Import/export

* Transform
   * Clean up
   * Reshape to tidy form
   * Process
   
* Visualize



???
The goal of this course is to introduce the tidyverse, a collection of data
science tools within R for transforming and visualizing data.

---

# Other tools

* Base R
* {data.table}
* ...

--

Tidyverse strong points:

* Readable code
* Very wide range of features
* Documentation convenient to navigate
* Professional maintainers
* RStudio integration


???
There are other data manipulation tools in R, and we cannot do everything with
the tidyverse. {data.table} is a common and excellent alternative, that favors
compact code, execution speed and low dependencies. We can also do a lot with
base R. Nevertheless in our sense the tidyverse provides the most intuitive and
versatile framework out there.

These tools are maintained by RStudio, the company that designed the user
interface of the same name, that you use to program in the R language, this means
there is a solid team and budget behind it and that that they are very attentive
to bug reports and new features that might help users.

# The {tidyverse} package

Tidyverse is meta-package!

* Does not contain much functionality
* Loads a set of packages: the "core" tidyverse packages

```{r, eval}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

???

tidyverse is a meta package, when you attach it, using `library(tidyverse)`,
you attach several packages, these packages each have their specificity and are
sometimes useful in isolation but they're designed to work together, using
harmonized convention, so for the purpose of data analysis it's often very
convenient to be able to type `library(tidyverse)` and have (almost) all the tools we need.

---

# Core tidyverse packages

No need to memorize them! But it's good to recognize the names

* **readr**: to read or write rectangular data
* **dplyr**: to manipulate tidy data.
* **tidyr**: to tidy the data
* **tibble**: to improve the native data frame
* **purrr**: to work with functions and vectors.
* **stringr**: to work with strings
* **forcats**: to work with factors
* **ggplot2**: to create graphics

???
You don't need to remember which function comes from which package!
You can always print the function if you need to know!

---

# Auxiliary tidyverse packages?

There is (much) more! 

Auxiliary (helper) packages:

* not loaded by `library(tidverse)`
* same group of maintainer, same philosophy, same conventions

short list:

* lubridate
* readxl
* glue


???

Technically, the above are the "core" tidyverse packages, there is more!
Other RStudio packages form the extended tidyverse but are not attached by
`library(tidyverse)`, some interesting ones are lubridate, readxl and glue.

---

# Getting help
 
* Don't remember everything!
* Practice forgetting and recovering information

* Doc is usually good: `?some_function`
* http:://www.tidyverse.org -> links to package sites
  * Introduction to package's main functions
  * Function reference shows help pages by category
  * Vignettes illustrate use cases
* Rstudio commmunity: https://community.rstudio.com
* Twitter: #rstats
* StackOverflow: http://www.stackoverflow.com

???
You're not supposed to remember everything! You really don't need to remember
 much in fact, but you need to know the path to the information.
 `?` works pretty well! running the examples help
 tidyverse website, package websites with vignettes and reference
 humans!
 * Rstudio forum have volunteers and staff help you with any R question, and won't ever make you
 feel bad about a "silly" question, especially if it's about their packages!
 * Twitter: the R community is really positive and you might get a great answer really fast #rstats
 * Stackoverflow: the ultimate Q&A site if you have a more complex question, look
 if it has been asked, take the time to formulate it well and you'll be answered very fast
