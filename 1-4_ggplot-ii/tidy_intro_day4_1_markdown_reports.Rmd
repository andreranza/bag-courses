# R Markdown

R Markdown file (.Rmd) provide a way to write reports that contain both
text and code.

These can be rendered to show results and plots that are always up to date
with the provided data.

Find the full documentation at :

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/

Or use the cheat sheet in RStudio

rMarkdown was created by RStudio so it's very well integrated in the editor!

# Your first Rmd report

* File/New File/R Markdown... Or "+" icon top left /R Markdown
* Look around but keep the default choice (document + html)
* Give a name to your file (e.g. "My first report")
* Save your document (e.g. "My_first_report.Rmd")
* Look at the default content, can you guess what it does ? 
  * Hint: the default content tells you what it does!
* Use the "knit" button at the top of the editor
* A report appears, compare its content to which of the Rmd file
* A new file has appeared next to your Rmd file

---

# Report preview

You can customize if you want to see the preview :
* In the viewer pane
* In a separate window
* nowhere

To do so : Tools/Global Options/Code/R Markdown/Show output preview

Go change the setting, and see which one you like better

---

# Components

* Header
* Text
* Code

---

# Components

* Header : 
  * YAML (Language often used for configuration files)
* Text :
  * Markdown (A lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor)
* Code : 
  * R (you know this one!s)

---

# The YAML header

The top lines, encapsulated by `---`, are called the *YAML header*.

It is were the document settings are stored, currently the title and the output format.

A new language, but we don't really have to learn it!

You can use the gear icon / output options to change basic parameters of the report without
having to learn anything more about YAML

---

# YAML header, output

`output` can have many values:

.pull-left[
context_document
github_document
html_document
latex_document
md_document
odt_document
pdf_document
rtf_document
word_document]

.pull-right[
beamer_presentation
ioslides_presentation
powerpoint_presentation
slidy_presentation
]

To use `pdf_document` you'll need `install.packages("tinytex")` and
`tinytex::install_tinytex()`

---

# YAML header, output

Try to create a new Rmd document directly as an `ioslides_presentation`

---

# Markdown 
 
 The text is written in markdown
 
 A new language, but an easy one! (It's the one used for wiki articles like wikipedia's)
 
 Text means everything that is not graphics, tables or calculations. It includes:
 * headers
 * pictures
 * formulas
 
---

# Text: The Markdown Syntax 
 
 It is basically plain text with some formatting rules
 
.pull-left[
\*\*bold text\*\* 

\*italic text\*

\#\#\# header 3

`` `r '\x60code\x60'` ``

\- bullet point 
]

.pull-right[
**bold text**

*italic text*

### header 3

`code`

- bullet point
]

---

# Text: The Markdown Syntax 
 
For link and images you can use:

`[](https://cran.r-project.org)`

`[link description](https://cran.r-project.org)`

`![](https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.jpg)`

---

# Text: The Markdown Syntax 
 
To go to a new line in the output document you can either skip one line entirely in the Rmd or finish your line with two spaces and go to the next line.

---

# Code : Inline

If we replace single quotes by backticks, the following :

Today is 'r Sys.Date()'

will print as :

Today is `r Sys.Date()`

Inline code is sometimes useful but usually we'll use chunks much more!

---

# Code : Chunks

If we replace single quotes by backticks, the following :

'''{r}  
x <- 1  
y <- 1 + x  
y  
'''  

will print as 

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 1 + x
y
```

---

# Code : Chunk options

R *chunks* contain R code. They do everything what is not text --
graphs, tables, calculations.

We can set options to chunks, they set up wherever the code, results, or figures
are displayed, the size of the figures etc

They're documented there: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html

We'll see the main ones

---

# Code : Chunk options

Often, you want to show the result of a calculation in your report, but not
the calculation itself, for this you can use `echo = FALSE` 
    
     # ```{r, echo = FALSE}
     # rnorm(10)
     # ```
     
Note: ignore the comments, `#`, they are there to tell R
not to execute the code

---

# Code : Chunk options

Sometimes, this is not enough. Package startup messages will still be shown.
To turn them off as well, use  `message = FALSE`:
     
     # ```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
     # library(forecast)
     # ```
---

# Code : Chunk options
  
To display R code without evaluating it, you specify the `eval = FALSE` chunk
option:
     
     # ```{r, eval = FALSE}
     # rnorm(10)
     # ```
---

# Code : Chunk options
   
To control the width and the height of your graph, use the `fig.width` and
`fig.height` option:
     
     # ```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8, echo = FALSE}
     # plot(cars)
     # ```

---

# Code : Chunk options
   
To cache a chunk so it will be reevaluated only if the code change, use the
`cache` option:

     # ```{r, cache = TRUE}
     # sys.sleep(cars)
     # ```

---

# Code : Chunk options

These options can be set globally at the top with `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)`
