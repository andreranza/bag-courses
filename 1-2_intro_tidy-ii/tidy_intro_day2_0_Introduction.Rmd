# General remarks

- Even though we are starting out remotely, we hope for these courses to be interactive: go ahead and ask if something is unclear!
- You can also write into the chat, which I will try to monitor when Antoine is presenting.
- We were asked to provide recordings of the courses for those of you who cannot join, so recording is activated.
- Per course unit, we offer 4 hours of follow up time; approach us with questions (nicolas@cynkra.com)!

# Assignment in R

Assignment means we *bind* a *value* to a *name* in an *environment*.

.pull-left[
```{r}
a <- FALSE
b <- "a"
c <- 2.3
d <- c(1, 2, 3)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("bindings.png")
```
]

The assignment operator `<-` performs this *binding* in the current environment, here the global environment (`.GlobalEnv`).

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
0a <- 1
```
```
## Error: unexpected symbol in "0a"
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if <- 1
```
```
## Error: unexpected assignment in "if <-"
```
]

There are some rules as to what names are permissible.

---

# Retrieving values

A value can be accessed via its name (not a string!).

.pull-left[
```{r}
a
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
b
```
]

(If it is accessible from the current environment.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
some_crazy_name
```
```
## Error: object 'some_crazy_name' not found
```

Bindings in an environment can be listed using `ls()`.

.pull-left[
```{r}
ls()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ls(envir = new.env())
```
]

---

# What objects are accessible?

.pull-left[
```{r}
ls()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
mean
```
]

```{r, include = FALSE}
width <- options(width = 50)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
search()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
library(readr)
search()
```
]

```{r, include = FALSE}
options(width)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("search-path.png")
```

---

# Base R vector classes I

The function `c()` can be used to combine objects, such as literals.

```{r}
x_log <- c(TRUE, FALSE)     # same as c(T, F)
x_int <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)      # use 1L to enforce integer, rather than numeric
x_num <- c(1, 2, 6.3, 0.12) # also called 'double'
x_chr <- c("Hello World")   # or 'Hello World'
```

We can check the type using `class()` and the length with `length()`.

.pull-left[
```{r}
class(x_log)
class(c(x_int, x_chr))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
length(x_chr)
length(c(x_int, x_chr))
```
]

There is no type distinction between scalar and vector values!

???
There is a certain order in the list above: `logical` is the least flexible
type, while `character` is the most flexible. If you combine vectors of
different type, the more flexible class will win

---

# Base R vector classes II

The class of a vector can safely be changed to a more "general" type.

.pull-left[
```{r}
as.logical(c(1, 0, 2))
as.integer(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
as.numeric(c("1", "2"))
as.character(c(TRUE, FALSE))
```
]

A change to a more "specific" general type is also possible.

```{r}
as.numeric(c("hi", "number", "1"))
```

???
These functions will always work if you coerce towards greater flexibility.
If you want to go the other way, it may give you `NA`s and some warnings.

---

# Sequences & repetitions

Often we need to create vectors with patterns, such as sequences

.pull-left[
```{r}
1:5
seq(1, 5)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
seq(3, 9, by = 2)
seq(0, 1, length.out = 5)
```
]

or repetitions

.pull-left[
```{r}
rep(5, 4)
rep("hello", 2)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
rep(1:4, 2)
rep(1:4, each = 2)
```
]

---

# Basic arithmetic

Operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc. are implemented as functions

.pull-left[
```{r}
2 + 3
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
`+`(2, 3)
```
]

Operations are vectorized (element-wise)

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2,  4)
x +  c(5, 0, -1)

1:5 * 2
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2,  4)
x *  c(5, 0, -1)

1:5 * rep(2, 5)
```
]

---

# Recycling

In case of length mismatch, the shorter vector is recycled.

.pull-left[
```{r}
c(1, 2) + c(6, 0, 9, 20, 22, 11)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2) + c(6, 0, 9, 20, 22, 11)
```
]

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(6, 0, 9, 20, 22, 11)
```

Advice: in general, try to avoid beyond recycling length 1 vectors.

---

# Comparison operators

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 4, 2)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
y <- c(2, 2, 4, 5)
```
]

Inequality: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

.pull-left[
```{r}
x < 2
x < y
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x <= 2
x <= y
```
]

Equality (and its negation): `==`, `!=`

.pull-left[
```{r}
x == y
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x != y
```
]

---

# Logical operators

.pull-left[
```{r}
a <- x >= 2
a
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
b <- x < 4
b
```
]

Boolean operators: `&` (AND) or `|` (OR), `!` (NOT)

.pull-left[
```{r}
a & b
a | b
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
!a & b
!(a & b)
```
]

We also have `&&` and `||` (not discussed here)

---

# Numeric indexing

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- c(1.2, 3.9, 0.4, 0.12)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
i <- 3:4
```
]

We can extract values from a vector, using a numeric index.

.pull-left[
```{r}
x[c(1, 3)]
x[c(1, 1, 3)]
x[-1]
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x[2:3]
x[i]
x[-i]
```
]

---

# Logical indexing

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- c(1.2, 3.9, 0.4, 0.12)
x
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
(i <- rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), each = 2))
```
]

We can extract values from a vector, using a logical index.

.pull-left[
```{r}
x[i]
x[!i]
x[x > 2]
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x[TRUE]
x[FALSE]
x[-i]
```
]

???
last example: complete craziness! `-i` evaluates to `c(-1, -1, 0, 0)`, which selects all but the first element and adds nothing to this

---

# Subset assignment

Combines a subsetting operation with an assignment.

```{r}
y <- c(1.2, 3.9, 0.4, 0.12)

y[c(2, 4)] <- 5
y[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)] <- 5
y

y[y > 2] <- 2
y

y[y == 2] <- c(4, 5)
y
```

---

# Exercises (Homework)

1. Create a vector called `v1` containing the numbers 2, 5, 8, 12 and 16.
1. Extract the values at positions 2 and 5 from `v1`.
1. Use `x:y` notation to make a second vector called `v2` containing the
numbers 5 to 9.
1. Subtract `v2` from `v1` and look at the result.
1. Generate a vector with 1000 standard-normally distributed random numbers
(use `rnorm()`). Store the result as `v3`. Extract the numbers that are
bigger than 2.

---

# Solutions I

1. Create a vector called `v1` containing the numbers 2, 5, 8, 12 and 16.

```{r}
v1 <- c(2, 5, 8, 12, 16)
```

1. Extract the values at positions 2 and 5 from `v1`.

```{r}
v1[c(2, 5)]
```

1. Use `x:y` notation to make a second vector called `v2` containing the
numbers 5 to 9.

```{r}
v2 <- 5:9
```

---

# Solutions II

1. Subtract `v2` from `v1` and look at the result.

```{r}
v1 - v2
```

1. Generate a vector with 1000 standard-normally distributed random numbers
(use `rnorm()`). Store the result as `v3`. Extract the numbers that are
bigger than 2.

```{r}
v3 <- rnorm(1000)
v3[v3 > 2]
```

---

# Matrices

Internally represented by a column-major vector, with dimensions.

.pull-left[
```{r}
(m <- matrix(c(1, 4, 2, 2, 7, 3), nrow = 2))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
dim(m)
```
]

Two indexes are required for subset selection.

.pull-left[
```{r}
m[1, 2]
m[, c(2, 3)]
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
m[1, ]
m[1, , drop = FALSE]
```
]

---

---

# Solutions I

1. Create a 10 x 10 matrix that contains a sequence of numbers (use the `:`
notation).

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:100, ncol = 10)
```

1. Extract the 2. column of the matrix.

```{r}
mat[, 2]
```

1. Extract the 5. row of the matrix.

```{r}
v1 <- mat[5, ]
```

---

# Solutions II

1. Extract the 5. and the 6. row of the matrix.

```{r}
v2 <- mat[c(5, 6), ]
```

1. Compare the classes of the results to the previous two subsetting operations.

```{r}
class(v1)
class(v2)
```

---

# Solutions III

1. Modify 3., so that it returns the same class as 4.

```{r}
(v3 <- mat[5, , drop = FALSE])
class(v3)
```

---

# Lists

.pull-left[
```{r}
(x <- list(u = c(2, 3, 4), v = "abc"))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
length(x)
```
]

Subsetting can be done with `$`, `[` or `[[`

.pull-left[
```{r}
x$u
x[["u"]]
x[[1]]
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x["u"]
x[1:2]
```
]

---

# List subsetting mnemonic

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("lists.png")
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
(x <- list(list(1:3), list(4:6)))
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x[[1]][[1]]
x[[1]][[1]][1]
```
]

---

# Names

.pull-left[
```{r}
(x <- list(u = c(2, 3, 4), v = "abc"))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
names(x)
```
]

Any vector in R can have a names attribute.

.pull-left[
```{r}
(y <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3))
class(y)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
y[c("a", "b")]
```
]

---

# Data frames

2-dimensional like matrices, but implemented using lists

```{r}
(d <- data.frame(kids = c("Jack", "Jill", "Jamie"), ages = c(12, 10, 7)))
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
d[["ages"]] # same as d$ages
d[1, ]
d[, 1]
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
length(d) # same as ncol(d)
nrow(d)
dim(d)
```
]

---

# Exercises (Homework)

1. Generate two random vectors of length 10 (for example using `runif()`), `a`, and `b`. Combine them in a list, call it `l1`.
1. Compare the classes of `l1[2]` and `l1[[2]]`. Can you explain the
difference?
1. How many rows does the data frame `mtcars` contain? The dataset is available by default. Just try typing `mtcars`.
1. Of what type is the column `vs` of `mtcars`.
1. Try printing the column names of `mtcars`.

---

# Solutions I

1. Generate two random vectors of length 10 (for example using `runif()`), `a`, and `b`. Combine them in a list, call it `l1`.

```{r}
a <- runif(10)
b <- runif(10)
l1 <- list(a, b)
```

1. Compare the classes of `l1[2]` and `l1[[2]]`. Can you explain the
difference?

.pull-left[
```{r}
class(l1[2])
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
class(l1[[2]])
```
]

Subsetting a list using `[`, will return a list, whereas using `[[`, the object contained in the list at the given position is returned.

---

# Solutions II

1. How many rows does the data frame `mtcars` contain? The dataset is available by default. Just try typing `mtcars`.

```{r}
nrow(mtcars)
```

1. Of what type is the column `vs` of `mtcars`.

```{r}
class(mtcars$v2)
```

1. Try printing the column names of `mtcars`.

```{r}
colnames(mtcars)
```
